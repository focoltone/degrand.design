							<h2>Minimize errors in the platform</h2>
							<p>We spent our first week going over the request from the client to help reduce errors for their Google Search ads. I spoke with our business analyst (BA), who is also a digital marketing expert. He explained the problem we are trying to solve. </p>
							<p>During the week I sketch some ideas on the iPad and go over them with the BA. We log into the platform and look at the issues, I look at other design patterns in other tools and software that are similar to the concepts I have sketched. </p>
						</section>

						<section>
							<h2>Enhance an existing feature of the application</h2>
							<p>The platform includes a fillable form to create text and a URL for the Google ads. There is a special feature in the platform that allows you to add snippits of text that act as a placeholder for different values.</p>
							<p>In the form example, these fields become the simplified URL a person sees in the ad in the Google search results. This is important because it gives you an idea of where you will be taken once the ad is clicked.</p>
							<p>The text in Path 1 and 2 will reference content defined in another part of the platform. The problem is, Path 1 and 2 have character limits: 15 characters max, and the values that replace these variables often exceed the character limit.</p>
						</section>

							<h1>Discovery</h1>
							<p>1st Week — (MAR 18th - MAR 22nd)  </p>
						</div>

						<section>
							<h2>These first conversations lay the ground work for developing good solutions</h2>
							<p>The BA and I had a call with the Digital Marketing Manager to walk us through creating an ad in the production environment, talk about his thought process, and describe the problem.
							</p>
							<p>I shared a link for us to look at some of the initial concepts the BA and myself agreed to showcase. I lead the discussion during these calls while the BA  guided us if digital marketing expertise was required to support the client’s needs. It is important for designers to take ownership of the experience design with the client, to build up the design language and thinking konwledge of our team members. If anyone has questions or ideas, I am best suited to explain the impact of those from a usability or interaction design perspective.
							</p>
							<p>The client was drawn to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/K2TQPe81H4phFR5ssTr6QDU0/Ad-Versions-Fields?node-id=0%3A1&scaling=min-zoom">the first concept <img src="images/link.svg"></a> we presented and explained why <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/eVZfqP74JxxfDZrwbgw1hYrR/Separate-versions-of-ads?node-id=0%3A1&scaling=min-zoom">the second concept <img src="images/link.svg"></a> was not the way he thought about working with ad versions. I typically weigh ideas for a feature on the fly or I let the client/user know we may find out more after testing. I am candid about the scope for the work and ideas beyond our teams capacity. 
							</p>
							<p>The client’s main request was to indent the fields that are added as subsequent versions to distinguish them from their parent. The BA and I thought this was a very useful suggestion; one that we had not thought of ourselves.
							</p>
							<p>We spent the rest of the week reworking our sketches, incorporating the client’s feedback and transferring ideas to a prototype. We checked in with the client later in the week to show them our progress. This could be a call or a Slack with links to sketches, sometimes even a short video if we wanted to demonstrate an interactive behavior. I also continued to research other tools, design patterns, and read up on the usability research documented on the concepts I was considering for the feature. I spent about 6 hours between the first two sprints on that type of research. That type of work is priority, and would be done earlier in the week or as soon as it becomes necessary so I had answers for the client or team members in subsequent meetings.
							</p>
						</section>
					

						<div class="feedback">
							<h3>Feedback:</h3>
							<p>Client said he expects to make 3 to 4 versions of each of the form fields.
							</p>
							<p>The current form as it is right now “works really well for me and I like the format”. 
							</p>
							<p>“Could we maybe indent version 2, 3, 4... so you can tell them apart from version 1 better?”

									<h1>Testing</h1>
									<p id="test">2nd Week (MAR 25th - 28th)</p>
								</div>
								<h2>Hitting a snag and validating early concepts with our target audience</h2>
								<p>In our design & testing step, we took our initial rough ideas from our sketches and validated them with members of our internal team and the client’s team.
								</p>
								<p>I started making a simple prototype that I could use to test with some of our team members who are familiar with our digital marketing products. 
								</p>
								<p>The BA on my team informed me that Google will be adding two additional fields to the ad form and our client needed them as soon as that change was implemented. Our tiny form was already getting an upgrade, but it might not be possible to accommodate all of these changes at this rate. I went ahead and created a mock-up of a the new form with the two additional fields and added the number of versions the client expected to use for each field of the form to test how well the form scaled. After seeing it, I realized we needed a different approach.
								</p>
								<p>I felt I had enough information from the client to move forward independently until I had something to present.
								</p>
								<p>My instinct was to bring the form into a modal view, providing a space for the person using the feature to focus. I also had to consider the need to house a much more robust feature that our form was turning into, one that the UI around it could no loger reasonably contain.
								</p>
							</section>
						</div>
						
						<div>
							<section >
								<p>I asked our developers if we could invoke a modal view for this feature. I broke the news in our next stand up and explained the need to move in another direction. I did an initial mock up of the new form for our whole team and the client in a meeting. 
								</p>
								<p>We maintained our original concept and explained the rationale for the modal view. Now, with a much larger area of screen real estate, we could lessen the stress of trying to fit everything in our main interface.  
								</p>
								<p>Testing the scalability really paid off, helping to visualize that our small, unobstrusive form was now a candidate for a design pattern that could scale smoothly.
								</p>
								<p>After clearing up our direction for the form’s UI we could move on to testing with prototypes. Our main goal was to bring down the number of failed ads caused by character limmit errors. To solve this, our dev team needed to loop through the text of each version of each field and check the final copy’s number of charcters before creating the ad. The design team needed to create a way for our client’s team to visualize and manage their versoins in a simple and intuative way.

							<h2>Prototyping</h2>
							<p>I introduced Figma to our team, a new design tool similar to Invision Stuido, to help us collaborate more effectively. It helped us across the board. I placed all of our research and sketches into one document that could be shared with anyone on the team. This increased the visibility of the design team’s work and allowed our team to interact more easily with our design process overall.</p>
							<h2>Collecting feedback</h2>
							<p>I sat with people in our company and asked them to complete a specific task or set of tasks. I asked them to talk about each step and verbalize their internal thought process. I observed them going through the prototype and recorded what I heard and saw during each session. I used a text editor to take my notes, but I had a chance to try a tool by OptimalWorkshop called Reframer, that made the process of recording feedback for testing sessions much more dynamic. Now, it is much easier to reference feedback and insights from testing and easily share it with my team members. </p>
							<p>I rapidly iterated versions of the prototype based on the new feedback from testing. I spent Monday through Wednesday testing and iterating the prototype and I am typically able to do sessions with 2 to 3 people. I always tested with our developers to give them exposure early on and begin to think about it from a technical perspective. Their expertise was always valuable. The feature benefited from testing with them in early stages of our process, and the developers felt more confident when estimating stories.</p>

							<h2>Final Design</h2>
							<p>This is the final result after several testing sessions, 6 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/Zyv1jhyOb8Gue4v4k1mA1sIT/Ad-Versions?scaling=scale-down&node-id=1%3A3201">prototype iterations <img src="images/link.svg"></a>, and synthesis of information collected. A great insight from one tester resulted in the additional ability to show and hide the versions: “I just want to be able to see my ad.” — CTO </p>
